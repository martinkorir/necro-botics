### Body bag

- Body bag that wriggles in the bath-tub
- 3d Printed Body https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1114406

- Mannequin that follows face:
  - https://github.com/rydercalmdown/halloween_mannequin_head
- First goal: connect ultrasonic sensors by the front door (and maybe bathroom hallway?)
  - then when someone comes in all the babies spin to look at u
- Then (light conditions permitting) we can try face tracking

- Needs clothes/mason jar contents, wiring up the ultrasonic sensors and servo motors
- For face tracking, need raspberry pi

### Bathroom robot
- Sense when someone enters the bathroom, start timer, start playing audio to scare them 
- Angela (or Reagan) records audio "Wash your hands you filthy animal","Number 1 or Number 2"   

#### Voice acting 
  * "Wash your hands you filthy animal"
  * "Number 1 or number 2"
  * [incoherent screaming]
